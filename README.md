Learning Python, JAVA and YAML
When creating new content, it is very important to think about promoting your abilites.
Still, who has time to do this?
Today, I made an effort to show this as an example, that I also edit content on GitHub!
Lets make a big effort this year!
Each month, will upday my work to show more of what I do.
To start lets highlight all the new content using a marker pair
  This means that all the new content will be highlighted with a pale yellow color because I will open it with a "<mark>' and close it with a "</mark>"
  
  Lets see it in action:
    <mark> Hello World, my name is Kimberly, my friends call me, "Qm"</mark>
    
    so it is marked in mark down, but where is it hosted?
